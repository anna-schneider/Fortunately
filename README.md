````<div className="button-container">
				{questions.map((item, index) => {
					return (
						<div
							className={`home-button-container ${item.fields.areas.toLowerCase()}`}
							key={index}
						>
							<Button
								text={item.fields.areas}
								to={`/results/${item.fields.areas}`}
							/>
							<img src="/images/Card.jpg" alt="" />
						</div>
